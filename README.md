# Binary-Bomb
This is a Binary Bomb Lab assignment from my course on Computer Architecture at Rutgers. 
The purpose of this lab assignment is to familiarize students with machine-level programs and tools, as well as develop debugging and reverse-engineering skills.

What is a Binary Bomb?

⊚ A program with multiple phases.

⊚ Each phase requires a specific input to defuse.

⊚ Incorrect input results in an explosion.

In the folder above, we have 3 files :
bomb.c This is the bomb in C code
bomb An executable file for you to run and debug from
solution.txt Solutions to defuse the bomb
